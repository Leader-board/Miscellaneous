# SAT resources

This section contains various resources that I made use of when preparing for the SAT Subject Tests in Maths Level 2, Physics and Chemistry as a student. Mostly found this off the internet, and stripped it of watermarks so that you can immediately use it (or print the book, like what I did). For the SAT (not the Subject Tests), Khan Academy is a wonderful resource, and I prepared for the SAT using *only* that website.

**Note:** An OCR-enabled version of the SAT Subject Tests Official Guide is available [here](https://universityofstandrews907-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/dm282_st-andrews_ac_uk/EQfV9Fj4x-xKlVhc3Eko8Q8BVch_L5oomDG-_2NjXssPHQ?e=IiEYvd). At 160 MB, that file is too big to be hosted on GitHub itself.
