TROUBLE SHOOTING

* This section contains information which should help if you run into
  trouble while playing the game.


-SLOW DOWN-

   +) If you experience problems of extreme slow down while switching
      between units there are a number of things you can try:

   -) Try switching your Windows color depth to 256 colors.
 
   -) Make sure that you have quit all other programs before running
      the game. Even small programs like the Microsoft Office Shortcut
      Bar take up valuable memory.

   -) After every couple of missions, try exiting the game completely.
      Wait for your hard disk to stop flashing, then restart the game
      and load up your latest level. This procedure allows Windows to
      clear its internal memory and help free up more for the game.

   -) If your budget will stretch to it, consider upgrading your RAM to
      32MB or more. This will have a dramatic affect on the speed of
      this (and many other!) games.

BMPs & WAVs

* Try copying 5 or 6 ".WAV" and bitmaps to a floppy disk, then have this
  disk in the drive when you start playing the game. If you take one of
  your units to the 'A:\' directory in the game you will be able to see
  these files displayed on the walls...
