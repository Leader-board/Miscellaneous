# VIRUS The Game

Uploading this here (from BetaArchive) since I noticed that the original link at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrh_brEZmvo was down. Simply copy these files to your VM (or run it in the host if that's what you prefer), and enjoy. Note that an older OS (like Windows 98) may run this game better than newer versions.

The structure of this repositery might meant that you have to clone the whole repo to get the game, which won't be ideal since there are other unrelated folders in this repo as well. You might want to download it from [here](https://universityofstandrews907-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/dm282_st-andrews_ac_uk/EV0BSJ3mpDhNijR_-CBlLQMBN-LEfkYco0osRtLrudeD1Q?e=rMdbX4) instead, which is a ZIP file of the game. At 170 MB, it's too big for GitHub.

_Hint: The game does not work well on virtual machines as it is too fast, as shown in the video above._

Also the original one on BetaArchive (https://www.betaarchive.com/database/view_release.php?uuid=e775f699-8ee0-4cb9-a76f-f48c25fe09d8) is in a MDF format, and tools like Daemon would be required to extract the original files (or possibly convert to an ISO).
