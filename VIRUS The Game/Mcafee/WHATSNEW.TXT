NEW FEATURES 

1.  VirusScan's powerful new user interface provides 
    advanced scan configuration settings and a complete
    Tools menu. From the Tools menu, users can: Password 
    protect scan tasks, gain access to the McAfee Virus 
    List, and start the VirusScan Console. The Tools menu
    is conveniently located in VirusScan's main window.     

2.  The VirusScan Console is an intuitive addition to
    VirusScan for Windows 95. The VirusScan Console
    facilitates easy and efficient scheduling and 
    configuring of scan tasks. 

3.  VirusScan now offers configuration lockdown for 
    both the on-demand scanner and VShield, the on-access
    scanner, through password protection. 
 
    Users or administrators can now password protect scan
    settings to prevent unintentional changes being made.

4.  ScreenScan is now compatible with 3-D screen savers 
    in Windows 95 OSR2. 

5.  Increased file compression scanning capabilities.
    VirusScan now scans files compressed with PKLITE,
    LZEXE, and LHA compression software.

6.  VShield is now compatible with Microsoft's 'FindFast' 
    Fast File Indexer that comes with MS Office. Now, while 
    FindFast indexes your files for faster access, VShield 
    will check them for macro viruses. Now you can have fast,
    safe access to all your documents.

7.  VShield now supports Novell Client32.

________________________________
ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THIS RELEASE

1.  Issues surrounding the removal of LAROUX.A and LAROUX.E 
    Excel macro viruses have been resolved.  

____________
KNOWN ISSUES

1.  The new 3000 series DATs contained in VirusScan v3.1.1
    are not backward compatible with the VirusScan v2.x
    series. The 3000 series DATs should not be used with
    VirusScan v2.x products.

2.  Windows 95 no longer requires MS-DOS memory managers.
    Using MS-DOS memory managers may cause VirusScan for
    Windows 95 to falsely detect viruses in memory. To
    eliminate false warnings, remark (Rem) the memory 
    manager lines from your CONFIG.SYS to deactivate them.

3.  ScreenScan's log file has a maximum size of 100KB. If
    the file reaches this size, the oldest data will be
    deleted. To retain logging data, you should edit the
    content to keep the log file under 100K or save the
    oldest data to another file.

4.  ScreenScan will stop scanning after it detects a 
    virus and prompt you to launch VirusScan. If you have
    additional viruses on your system, ScreenScan will not
    notify you until the next time it activates. McAfee
    recommends that you scan and clean your entire system
    with VirusScan whenever ScreenScan detects a virus.

5.  After uninstalling ScreenScan, the screen saver will
    be set to None. You can reactivate your screen saver
    from the Display Properties.

6.  If using CTRL+ALT+DEL to shut down a Windows 95 system
    when VShield or any other VxD is enabled, Windows will
    not shut down. However, VShield or the VxD will be
    disabled. Windows will not shut down unless the shut
    down process is repeated. This is a known issue with
    Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system.   

7.  When creating an Emergency Disk, you must close all 
    open windows to the floppy drives. The Emergency Disk
    creation utility must have exclusive access to the 
    floppy or the system file transfer may fail, making
    the disk non-bootable.    

8.  If password protection is set for VShield or any
    scan task, when an associated program is launched, you 
    will be prompted to verify the password. You must use 
    the mouse to click in the text field to enter the 
    password, or click on Cancel to exit. Keyboard strokes
    are not functional. This is a Microsoft issue as stated 
    in Microsoft's Knowledge Base Article ID #Q84133.

9.  The Status properties page for VShield Properties can
    only be updated by closing and reopening VShield's Task
    Properties window.

10. If an .LZH file is infected with the Concept macro
    virus, you must first decompress the file to delete
    the virus.

11. The VShield component of VirusScan 3.1.0 and v3.1.1
    contains significant enhancements over the VShield 
    component of VirusScan 3.0.0. Because of these extensive
    modifications to the product, McAfee strongly recom-
    mends you reboot your system after installing the new
    version of VirusScan. You will not be protected by
    VShield until you reboot.

12. When running two or more instances of Scan32.EXE and two or 
    more LHA compressed archives are scanned simultaneously,
    Scan32.EXE will terminate with a page fault.

13. Scan32.EXE is not fully compatible with FAT32 boot sectors.

14. When an infected file is unzipped directly to a Novell 
    server, VShield will not detect the infection as the file
    is created. For maximum security, use VirusScan to scan
    the Novell server after the files have been unzipped to 
    the server.

15. Because disk defragmentation programs move files around as
    they maximize disk efficiency, applications running during 
    a disk defragmenting program session may return an error 
    message stating files cannot be found. 

____________
INSTALLATION         

* INSTALLING THE PRODUCT *

1.  Do one of the following:
    
    - If installing from diskette or compact disc, insert it 
      into your floppy disk drive or CD-ROM drive.

    - If installing from files downloaded from a BBS or the 
      McAfee Web Site, decompress the zipped files into a 
      directory on the network or your local drive.

2   Select Run from the Start menu.

3.  If installing from diskette, type x:\setup.exe where x 
    is the drive in which you placed the diskette. Click OK.

    If installing from compact disc, type x:\win95\setup.exe
    where x is the drive in which you placed the CD-ROM. 
    Click OK.

    If installing from downloaded files, type 
    x:\path\setup.exe  where x:\path is the location of the
    files (for example, C:\DOWNLOAD\SETUP.EXE). Click OK.

    Response: The Welcome screen is displayed. Click Next to 
    continue.

4.  Follow the on-screen installation instructions to 
    complete VirusScan installation.

5.  When installation is complete, reboot your system
    for the changes to take effect. 
 

* PERFORMING A SILENT INSTALLATION *

If you would like to perform a "silent" installation
of VirusScan, requiring minimal user interaction and
using all default or "Typical" installation settings,
add -s (i.e. SETUP.EXE -s) to the setup command when
you install the product.

Network Administrators can customize the silent
installation feature by following the steps outlined
below.

1.  Check in the Windows directory to ensure that a
    file named SETUP.ISS does not already exist. If it
    does, rename it, back it up, or delete it.

2.  Run SETUP.EXE with the -r switch, (i.e. SETUP.EXE -r).

3.  Select the components you would like to be installed
    during the silent installation.  All responses will
    be recorded.

4.  Finish the installation, and locate the file SETUP.ISS
    in the Windows directory.

    Note: You can modify this file to allow the instal-
          lation to copy the VirusScan files to the drive
          where the operating system resides instead of 
          defaulting to the C: drive by following the 
          instructions below:
          
          Locate the section [SdSetupType-0] in the 
          SETUP.ISS file and go to the line: Result=x

          where x is equal to:
          301 (Typical installation)
          302 (Compact installation)
          303 (Custom installation)

          Add 100 to the above value, so that the Result
          variable is equal to 401, 402, or 403. 

7.  Copy the installation files onto a local or mapped
    drive, then rename, back up, or delete the SETUP.ISS
    file.

    Note: A silent install cannot be performed from
          multiple media as the silent operation will be
          comprimised when the install prompts the user
          for more media. 

8.  Copy the new SETUP.ISS from the Windows directory
    to the location of the installation files.

9.  Run SETUP.EXE with the -s switch (i.e. SETUP.EXE -s).

    NOTE: If you do not specify a "recorded" answer for
    all dialog boxes during the initial installation, the
    silent installation will fail. Also, the file used
    for the silent installation, SETUP.ISS, may not work
    properly across different operating systems. For
    example, if the silent install is generated for
    Windows 95, it may not work properly in Windows 3.1x
    or Windows NT.

10. When the silent installation is complete, the machine 
    will reboot automatically.

* TESTING YOUR INSTALLATION *

The Eicar Standard AntiVirus Test File is a combined 
effort by anti-virus vendors throughout the world to 
come up with one standard by which customers can verify 
their anti-virus installations. To test your 
installation, copy the following line into its own 
file and name it EICAR.COM.

X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*

When done, you will have a 69- or 70-byte file.

When VirusScan is applied to this file, SCAN will report 
finding the EICAR-STANDARD-AV-TEST-FILE virus.

THIS IS NOT A VIRUS. However, users often have the need to
test that their installations function correctly. The anti-
virus industry, through the European Institute for Computer
Antivirus Research, has adopted this standard to
facilitate this need.

Please delete the file when installation testing is
completed so unsuspecting users are not unnecessarily
alarmed.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 

Regularly updated lists of frequently asked questions 
about McAfee products also are available on McAfee's 
BBS, website, and CompuServe and AOL forums.

Q:  Why are my scheduled scan tasks not performed?

A:  If you have configured a scheduled scan and it does
    not take place on schedule, it is likely that you did not
    have the VirusScan Console open when the scan was to take
    place. The VirusScan Console must be open (it may be 
    minimized) in order for the scan to take place.


Q:  VirusScan detected a virus on my system, but it is not
    a document, spreadsheet, or executable file (.EXE, .COM,
    .DO?, .XL?). Therefore, I suspect it may be a false 
    detection. What can I do to verify a detected virus?

A:  If you suspect a false detection on a non-executable 
    file, run VirusScan's command line scanner, SCAN.EXE, 
    to verify an infection. If VirusScan for Windows95 
    detects a virus and SCAN.EXE does not, please download
    the latest DAT files to upgrade your virus definition
    files and scan your system again. If VirusScan still
    detects a virus that you suspect to be a false 
    detection, please report the issue to McAfee technical
    support.


Q:  I would like to electronically purchase and download
    the latest version of VirusScan for Windows 95. I do
    not want to give my credit card information over the 
    Internet for security purposes. Can I purchase 
    VirusScan via modem and download the product via the 
    Internet?

A:  Yes. The first time you download VirusScan for
    Windows 95, the McAfee electronic Wizard will prompt
    you to select the transmission method you prefer to
    download and to transmit your encrypted credit card
    information.

    At the Transaction Connection Type dialog box, select
    Internet to download your order via the Internet.
    At the Security Connection Type dialog box, select
    Direct Dial Modem to transmit your credit card
    information via modem.


Q:  While downloading a licensed copy of VirusScan for
    Windows 95, the installation was interrupted and/or
    canceled. Where can I find my licensed VirusScan files
    and how do I proceed with the installation?

A:  The files are in the VSint folder located in the
    Windows Temp directory. Double click on SETUP.EXE
    within the VSint folder to continue with the
    installation.


Q:  I have created my own Emergency diskette without using
    the Emergency Disk creation utility. How must I optimize
    my emergency disk's performance?

A:  To enable your own Emergency Disk, you must create a
    CONFIG.SYS file on the boot diskette and add the
    following lines:

       [CONFIG.SYS]
       DEVICE=HIMEM.SYS
       DOS=HIGH
    
    Add the HIMEM.SYS file from the DOS directory or if you
    are using Windows 95 system files, add HIMEM.SYS from
    the \WINDOWS\COMMAND directory to the boot diskette.

    Note: For detailed instructions on creating an Emergency
    diskette, refer to the instructions outlined in the
    electronic documentation (.PDF file) included in your
    VirusScan package.


Q:  I moved a .VSC file to my Startup folder.
    Whenever I turn on my PC, it launches VirusScan for
    Windows 95, but it does not begin scanning. How can I
    make it start scanning automatically?

A:  You need to customize your options. Take these
    steps:

    1.  Navigate to the location of the saved .VSC file.
    2.  Right-click on the .VSC file to reveal the 
        Context Menu.
    3.  From the Context Menu, select Properties.  
    4.  Select the Options Tab on the property sheet. 
    5.  Check the Start Automatically box.

    By enabling this option, scanning will begin 
    automatically. If viruses are not detected VirusScan
    for Windows 95 will automatically close and free up
    system resources.


Q:  When VirusScan for Windows 95 is launched, how does it
    determine the default settings?

A:  VirusScan for Windows 95 default settings may be
    found in the DEFAULT.VSC file located in the install
    directory.


Q:  What are the possible error codes returned by
    CHKVXD.EXE?

A:  The possible CHKVXD.EXE error level codes and their
    descriptions are listed below:

    65535(-1)= VShield not installed

    0 = VShield ensabled

    1 = VShield disabled 


Q:  How can I tell that ScreenScan is working?

A:  ScreenScan does not alert you when it is scanning your
    system. However, if you enable the logging option during
    your configuration, all ScreenScan activity will be
    recorded in a log file in the Installation directory. 


Q:  How can I scan multiple or network drives with
    VirusScan?

A:  You can configure scans of multiple or network drives 
    from the Detection property page in the  Tools Advanced
    menu. To scan multiple or network drives, follow the
    steps below:

    1.  At the Detections property page, click Add.
    2.  Do one of  the following:
         - To add all network drives to the Detection list,
           click Select Item to Scan and select All Network
           drives. 
         - To add drives to the Detection list, click Select
           Drive or Directory to Scan. Enter a drive letter
           or click Browse to locate the drive you want
           scanned.
    3.  Click  Okay. 
    4.  Repeat this procedure to add additional drives to
        the Detection list.    
    5.  Save your settings by selecting Save Settings in the
        File menu.
 
    
Q:  Can I update McAfee's data files to detect new viruses?

A:  Yes. If your data files are out-of-date, VirusScan for
    Windows 95 will periodically prompt you to update them.
    If you have a modem or Internet connection, you can use
    VirusScan's new electronic update feature for easy data
    file updates, technical support, and registration. 
    
    Note: VirusScan's electronic update feature applies to
    the retail and evaluation copies of VirusScan only. If 
    you own a corporate copy of VirusScan, please notify 
    your System Administrator to receive your data file
    updates.

    If you need additional assistance with downloading, 
    contact McAfee Download Support at (408) 988-3832.

Q:  Why are there two sets of data files available for 
    download from www.McAfee.com?

A:  One set, which has a filename beginning with 30, is 
    compatible with VirusScan versions 3.0.0 and later. 
    This is the file you will download to update your 
    installation of VirusScan. The second set, which has a 
    filename beginning with 97, is designed to support 
    older versions of VirusScan (previous to v3.0.0) and 
    should not be used with this version of VirusScan.
