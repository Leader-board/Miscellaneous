# Calculus: Early Transcendentals

3rd edition. Published it here because the version given by Pearson is hard to use (both the 'interactive' and the static version). Note that this is not really a substitute, as you'll usually still need the access code to do your homework (like in my case), so there is no going aronud paying for the access code, unfortunately.

Note that to keep the file size within GitHub's limits, I had to compress the book using 7zip. You can easily decompress that file, and a PDF should come out.
