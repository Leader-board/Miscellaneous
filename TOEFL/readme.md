# TOEFL resources

I had to write the TOEFL as I was applying for universities in the US and UK, and this section contains some useful resources which I used when preparing for that examination.

For the official book published by ETS, the CD download is available [here] (https://universityofstandrews907-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/dm282_st-andrews_ac_uk/ETRZnFES-_FDqr08DBSVc3gB93mcDh1PIxDl9BKiCNgEwA?e=5aqir0). It is absolutely unnecessary to get the printed book (the CD is unfortunately not sold individually as far as I know), as it is essentially just a transcript of what is on the CD.
