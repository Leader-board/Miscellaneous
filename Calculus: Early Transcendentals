# Calculus: Early Transcendentals

3rd edition. Published it here because the version given by Pearson is hard to use (both the 'interactive' and the static version). Note that this is not really a substitute, as you'll usually still need the access code to do your homework (like in my case), so there is no going aronud paying for the access code, unfortunately.
