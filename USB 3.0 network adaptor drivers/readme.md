# Network adaptor drivers

This section contains the 'drivers' I extracted from the adaptor for the network adaptor described at https://goughlui.com/2016/03/17/quick-review-teardown-avoid-driving-fast-card-usb-3-0-ethernet-adapter/, but I found it very difficult to get it working in Windows 10, and the solution involved testing it unde a Windows 7 VM and then extracting the drivers (as shown in the article, it works by emulating a CD), through in hindsight it would have worked if I inserted the USB drive half-way.
